"Throughout Heaven and Earth, I alone am the honored one" Gojo Satoru declares, staring down the fraudxians. The goo furries sink back in fear as he utters the last words they'll ever hear... "Guess I'll be a little rough. Cursed Technique Amplification: Blue. Cursed Technique Reversal: Red. Hollow... Purple!" screamed The Strongest as he unleashed his strongest cursed technique upon them, instantly erasing all of them. The Gootraxians cornered the injured Nanami, Maki, Naobito and Megumi. As the furries tried to move in for the kill, Megumi opened his domain to attempt and create an escape route. As the hole in the domain was opened, a pair of hands reached out through it. "Those who inherited the curse of the Zen'in family, and the one who couldn't fully leave behind that curse. They would all bear witness to the bare flesh of the one who is free. To the one who left it all behind and his overwhelming intensity!" The Narrator states boldly as The Sorcerer Killer pulls up through the domain barrier, speed-blitzing Maki and stealing her Playful Cloud. The Gootraxians whimper in fear as they bear witness to the true Honored One as he slowly strikes them down with the cursed tool. As The Nightcrawler attempts Pursuit of the Sorcerer Killer, it gets struck on the back of the head. As the Nightcrawler looks behind to see the attacker, it was Toji Fushiguro, the Sorcerer Killer! The vessel of carnage struck the kobold one last time with Playful cloud, instantly killing it.
